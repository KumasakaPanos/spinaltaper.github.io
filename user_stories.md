User Stories:


Participant:

Old Person:
Boomers and older, retired and living off pensions in Seattle. Likely purchases which would be hosted on BusMall would be gifts rather than for self. Due to their inexperience with technology and reduced visual acuity a site designed to cater to the elderly must have larger than usual ui as well as easy actions to perform, i.e. taps, not drags.

Out of Stater:
Anyone who isn't local to Washington. These are not really relevent to the goals of the site. They could be helpful later, but for a start up which is rolling out only in Seattle, input from someone who won't reliably ride seattle transit isn't really helpful. Perhaps store their input seperately.

Local:
They are professionals anywhere from young adulthood to just before retirement. Merchandise for them can vary widely, as their interest can vary widely. However, they value their time more than the usual customer, so the site shouldn't waste time.

Youth:
They are people anywhere from 6-17. Compared to the average customer, they will have short attention spans, but be easily hooked and less money to access. As such, cheap but engaging items would help with getting sales from them. The site should be fast enough to avoid them clicking off.

Somewhat Local (edmonds etc.):
These are similar to the out of staters, but they are somewhat more relevent. Riding the bus every now and then, we should keep them in mind, but not value them above other groups. Probrably cordon off their input like with the out of staters.


Developer:

Me:
Build the site modularly using mostly functions because it keeps it neater and makes me happy.

Others:
Comment and explain each function comprehensively, so other developers who are cursed to handle my god forsaken scribblings can try to understand it.

Maintainer:

Similar to the other developers, make sure the code is easy to understand.



Marketing Team:

Make the data easy to access and understand. Perhaps have multiple tables or graphs so they can view the data in different manners.
